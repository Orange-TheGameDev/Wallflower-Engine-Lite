## WALLFLOWER ENGINE

Wallflower Engine Lite is a 2D small scale version of Wallflower Engine made in Python.

Specifically made with rapid prototyping in mind, this python version of Wallflower is made with game jams
and small projects in mind.

It uses a Python port of Dear ImGui for all engine GUI.

programmed by me, OK

Also this is **VERY** unfinished right now and not near completion - if you find any errors or faster ways to do things, feel free to let me know or contribute to the code :)
